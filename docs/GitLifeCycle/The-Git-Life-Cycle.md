# The Git Life Cycle 

The Git Life Cycle is the different stages the files and directory goes through when working with Git.


As you work with Git, it is best to be updated on the terminology and be knowledgable on the different states the directory and files goes through.

## Directory

There are three states that the directory goes through as you use Git Version Control.

- Working Directory

- Staging Area

- Git Directory

### Working Directory

In a local directory, as you make it a git repository by using the **git init** command, you let git become aware of your files and keeps track of your **Working Directory**.

```
git init
```

The working directory is the current state of your repository's files on disk.

As you add, delete or make changes on your files and other data types, the working directory saves all that data.
