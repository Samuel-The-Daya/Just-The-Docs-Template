## Collaborative Coding with Git and GitHub

With Git and GitHub, multiple developers can work on the same project without stepping on each other's toes.

Key concepts include:

- Forking: Creating a personal copy of another user's repository.
- Cloning: Downloading a repository to your local machine.
- Committing: Saving changes to the local repository.
- Pushing: Sending committed changes to a remote repository.
- Pull Request: Proposing changes to a repository that can be reviewed and potentially merged.
