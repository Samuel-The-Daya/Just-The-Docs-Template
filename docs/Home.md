# The Role of Version Control in Software Development    

**Version Control** also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the
management of changes to documents like computer programs.
CTRL-Z is the simplest form of version control

##### Some documents have more advanced version control built-in
- Microsoft Word has a "Track Changes" feature.
- Google Docs automatically tracks file changes over.
- You can see the edit history of all Wikipedia articles.
(Here's the history of the version control article.)

# What is Git?
## Version Control with Git 
- Git is a free and open source distributed version
control system.
- Git helps us keep track of the changes to our
source code over the lifespan of a project.
- When combined with cloud version control sites
like GitHub or GitLab, we can use git to
collaborate with others remotely.

## Why Git?
- With Git, you can make a "commit", or a save point, as often as you'd like.
- You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while
you're working.
- Commit often and commit early, and you'll never have that gut sinking feeling of
overwriting or losing changes.
- Allows us to work offline if necessarily and synchronize with a distributed team.

## Why Not Git?
**Downsides to working with git in game development:** 
- Not especially user friendly for non-developers.
- No built-in support for large repos, although the Git LFS add-on exists.
- No built-in support for locking binary assets. (Locking can be enabled with Git
LFS.)
