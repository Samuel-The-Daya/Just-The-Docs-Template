# Tags

## Introducing Tags
Tags in Git are like bookmarks for important events or milestones in your project.
They're often used to mark release points (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, etc.).

## Creating Tags
Creating a new lightweight tag:
```
git tag <tag-name>
git tag <tag-name> <commit hash>
```
This will tag the current or specified commit with the provided name.

Tag names should not include spaces. They should only include characters [a-z], [A-Z],
numbers [0-9] and the dash/hyphen [-].

## Annotated Tags
Annotated tags store additional metadata such as the tagger's name, email, date, and
an optional message.

``git tag -a <tag-name> -m "your message here"``

## Once You've Created a Tag
**Checkout to the tag**: You can treat the tag like a branch/commit, and checkout to the
tag's point in history. For instance, ``git checkout <tag-name> ``.

**List tags**: You can list all the tags in the repository using ``git tag`` or ``git tag -l ``. To
narrow the list based on a search pattern, you can use ``git tag -l "<search-
pattern>" ``.

**Show tag information**: If you have annotated tags, you can view the associated
information with git show ``<tag-name> .``

**Compare differences**: You can compare the differences between the tagged state of
the code and the current HEAD using ``git diff <tag-name> .``
